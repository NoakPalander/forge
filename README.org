* Forge
Dependency-free and fast matrix library and algorithms.

* Building
** Library
Currently this is shipped as an executable for easier development, to build it run:
#+begin_src bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -S ../ -B .
$ cmake --build . --target forge
#+end_src

Alternatively you can use ~--target all~ if you want to build everything.

** Tests
The project contains several unit tests that can be compiled separately with:
#+begin_src bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -S ../ -B .
$ cmake --build . --target forge-test
#+end_src

The tests is a separate target as ~Catch2~ might not want to be downloaded & compiled every time we build the library. The test executable will be located at ~forge/build/test/forge-test~
